        <p>Known for its smooth writing, exceptional ink quality, and outstanding selection of colors and tip sizes, the UM-151
        (also known as the Signo DX) is one of our all-time favorite gel pens. Find the perfect one for any task, whether it's
        writing meticulous notes, marking your calendar, or decorating your scrapbook with colorful captions.</p>

        <p>Everything about this pen, from its solid construction to its carefully-formulated ink, ensures a wonderful writing
        experience. The sturdy tip does not bend or break, even with heavy-handed use. The pigment-based ink flows smoothly and
        is waterproof, fade-resistant, and feather-resistant. Much of this great performance is due to the special viscous
        properties of the ink. As the ink passes through the pen tip during writing, the viscosity drops to provide smooth ink
        flow. But immediately after it hits the paper, the ink returns to its viscous state to prevent feathering. You are left
        with beautiful clean lines that you can enjoy for a long time!</p>
