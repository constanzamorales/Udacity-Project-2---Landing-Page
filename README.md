# Landing Page - 2nd Project in Udacity Front end program

This project is part of Udacity's Front-end Development Nanodegree. It requires the student to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.
From Udacity's project summary:

*This project aims to give you real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. The functionality you will be using serves two purposes: to prepare you for appending dynamically added data to the DOM, and to show you how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site.*

### Project requirements
* Create a dynamically built navbar menu. Meaning every section added will be automatically indexed to the navbar menu.
* Add the functionality to scroll to each section once we click every menu item.
* Reflect visually the active section in the navbar menu.
* Scroll to top when we click the button at the bottom of the page.

#### Technologies used:
* HTML5
* CSS
* JavaScript (ES6)

*Basic code consisting of a static page was provided by Udacity so we could focus on the DOM manipulation part of the project.*
